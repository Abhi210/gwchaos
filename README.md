# gwchaos
Python code to simulate Spinning bodies in Kerr Black Hole using MPD Equation and find Chaos in GW emitted by the secondary bodies

This code is still in the development Phase. It is written using Python mainly but I am also trying my Hands on Julia for speed.

The main code can be found in Hamiltonian_MPD.ipynb. This contain code to calculate the solution of MPD Equation of two spinning Particle in Kerr Geometry.

The next thing is to Plot Poincare section and the Lyapunov Exponent. Currently, the code can do these both. 

The next stage is to Incorporate Gravitational Waves in this system and look for chaos using ML tools. 

There is another code named Chaotic_GW.ipynb which takes a simpler model and tries to look for Chaos in it. It is also written using Python (And Julia).

Our main reference in these project is:

The documentation of this code is still work in Progress. I will try to update it as soon as possible.
